# BMI-calculator-GO
This repository contains a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator written in Go. The project demonstrates basic programming concepts such as variables, user input, and conditional statements in Go.
Features
Takes user input for weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).

Calculates BMI using the formula:
Categorizes BMI into:
Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9
Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9
Obese: BMI ≥ 30
Displays BMI value and category.
Key Points
Input Handling:
fmt.Scan(&variable) is used to read user input.
Arithmetic Operations:
BMI is calculated using weight / (height * height).
Conditional Statements:
if, else if, and else are used to determine BMI category.
